Attached are the lyrics that we have chosen to feature in Chapter 1, 
which will introduce a "Canto City" setting, to the "Canto Specters" Storytelling aspect, that we hope to release on social media for promotion. This song is related to the theme of the prologue, and how the main character feels unhappy, and wishes to go to "Canto City" to find a greater and better community.
The storyline features a Specter who feels very unhappy with the current town they reside in and wish to take a "train" to "Canto City" (See twitter for more context)

This song is likewise a personal song to the team as it draws in parallels to reflect the idea of how many people in the web 3 currently feel exhausted from the hectic and chaotic "mainstream chains" and need to leave someplace where they are welcomed with open arms. ( aka canto :) )
